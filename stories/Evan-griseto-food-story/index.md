## Analysis: 
Breakfast burritos are a breakfast food originating from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Breakfast burritos stem from southwestern and Hispanic traditions where tortillas are used to combine and make the meal portable. New Mexican food is a blend of cultures including Hispanic and native cultures. Breakfast burritos can be prepared in many ways utilizing chile, different kinds of meat, and different ways of preparing ingredients inside the burrito.

The portability of a breakfast burrito is very convenient and allows the consumer to take their meal on the go, freeing up more time while also combining the entire breakfast. Its portability reflects Hispanic culture where specifically Hispanic men get up early in order to do physically laborious jobs. This allows the men to take their food with them and eat while on the way to work freeing up more time for them to sleep or spend more time with their families. 

Breakfast burritos like most foods originating from Hispanic origins are made by women as women are seen as caretakers of the home and family in Hispanic culture. Breakfast burritos allow Hispanic women to send their husbands with a balanced breakfast with them on the way to work. This allows women to shorten the time of preparing breakfast shorter and less laborious. Breakfast burritos include ingredients that are perceived as masculine like meats and huevos rancheros.

Breakfast burritos reflect the on-the-go and quick pace lifestyle Americans have adopted. Due to the relatively low difficulty and quickness of making a breakfast burrito makes it perfect for the consumerism and industrialization of American fast food. Many fast food chains have already adopted breakfast burritos in their menu with their own addition and preparation. The breakfast burrito has been Americanized with its adoption into fast food chains that utilize processed ingredients and marketing it as “a high protein loaded breakfast you can eat on the go. Many of these fast food versions don’t resemble Hispanic food in the slightest and remove Hispanic elements like chile and beans. 

Breakfast burritos are relativity cheap to make which is ideal for low income households. Breakfast burritos are calorie dense foods made from the staples of American breakfast including meat and eggs. This allows low income households to make cheap and quick breakfasts to eat before heading to work but it reflects the poor diet of the working class, we have seen throughout American history. 

Breakfast burritos still reflect Hispanic culture and traditions like community. Breakfast burritos allow coworkers, friends, and acquittances to interact over a meal outside of a restaurant setting. The different way of preparing and making breakfast burritos allow people to interact and compare how different restaurants and people make them. New Mexicans compare breakfast burritos from different places like Blakes Lotaburger, Golden Pride, and other New Mexican restaurants. These comparisons of New Mexican food is even reflected in New Mexico’s state question “red or green” referring to red or green chile which many New Mexicans put inside their breakfast burritos. Breakfast burritos are just another example of the New Mexican community that is connected by food and tradition.
